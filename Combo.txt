<b>7th Oct</b>
After a long time the entire map has been remade after it being lost to the void.
Some features or bugs might of been missed by me and testers as there was a lot in the old map.

GM messaging and achievements/presents will return in the next large update.
Your save files will still work.

I have added a tablet you can spawn in that replaces the wall menus, it can be resized and be made to fit onto walls in world options.
