Walkthrough edits:
Missing line in the founder page relating to hope based kills added.
Reworded blackening phase page to correctly state the founder is chosen before the PM.
Changed Trial order page to state day abilities can be used in trials. (due to it being more fun)
Clarified pre-nights can't be effected by action phase.
Game overview page re ordered.
Cross Swords page changed from "cannot contest twice in the same trial" to "cannot be rolled for both cross-swords."

This should be the last edit to walkthrough for a while outside of extra pages being added.
If there is anything you think should be in the walkthrough feel free to message Smuggles on discord.
