A Trial is considered a "Despair Win" if the Blackened is NOT Voted by a majority of Players, or if there is a tie on which Player is the majority Vote.
If a Trial is considered a “Neutral Win,” it means that both sides have accomplished their goal that Trial (this can only happen in unique situations with specific Card Abilities).

The maximum number of deaths that could happen each Day/Trial is two, however:
As the Blackened of each Trial is considered a death, only one other death is capable of happening. This means only one "You die if X" ability can take place this Trial. Which one takes place is based on which happens first, or a Speedroll if they both happen at the same time.
If there are multiple Trials on the same day, one Player can die alongside the Blackened for each Trial.
If the PM is the Blackened for a Trial, they are not considered dead after Trial, so two different "You die if X" abilities can cause deaths in this Trial.
